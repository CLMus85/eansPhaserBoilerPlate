## How to install and run game
- Install git
- On the commandline install nodeJs
    - This will automatically install npm which is used to run the game
- Inside commandline navigate to "eansPhaserBoilerPlate" folder
    - This should be achieved by entering `cd eanPhaserBoilerPlate`
- In command line run `npm install`
    - Our backend uses nodejs so this will install the resources our projects needs to run independently
- In command line run `npm start`
    - This script actually starts up our server (which means our game is running)
- Open up a web browser and go to this address `http://localhost:7777`
    - `http://127.0.0.1:7777` also works because these are representations of the "home" address

## Naming Convention
- camel casing
    - applies to coding, files, and folders
    - example: `var name = "eanCharacter"`
- no capitalizing 1st letters

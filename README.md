## How to install the game
- Install git
    - Here's an installion guide for [git](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git)
- Install github (optional)
    - Here's a link to installing  the desktop version of [github](https://desktop.github.com/)
- Install nodeJs
    - This will automatically install npm which is used to run the game
    - Linux/Ubuntu/Debian command to install nodeJs is `sudo apt-get install nodejs npm`
    - Here's a guide for the [Windows Installation of NodeJs](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-windows)
    - Here's a guide for the [Mac Installation of NodeJs](http://blog.teamtreehouse.com/install-node-js-npm-mac)
- Inside commandline navigate to "eansPhaserBoilerPlate" folder
    - This should be achieved by entering `cd eanPhaserBoilerPlate`
- In command line run `npm install`
    - Our backend uses nodejs so this will install the resources our projects needs to run independently
    
## How to run the game
- Inside commandline navigate to "eansPhaserBoilerPlate" folder (if you're not already there)
    - This should be achieved by entering `cd eanPhaserBoilerPlate`
- In command line run `npm start`
    - This script actually starts up our server (which means our game is running)
- Open up a web browser and go to this address `http://localhost:7777`
    - `http://127.0.0.1:7777` also works because these are representations of the "home" address
- From here you'll be able to play the game!

## Naming Convention
- camel casing
    - applies to coding, files, and folders
    - example: `var name = "eanCharacter"`
- no capitalizing 1st letters
